# Converter Project

## Introduction
This is a data manipulation/file conversion python script that aims to make projects that follow (more information [here](LINK)) more accessable to new data sets.
The intended purpose of this script is to convert a simple .csv of data into .dat files that can be read by AMPL.  

## Necessary Software and Libraries
To run, this code requires that you have a python interperter, and 3 libraries downloaded:
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
[Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
[PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/) 

## Instructions
To use this code, make sure that the .csv file that you would like to convert (two such .csvs have been provided in this repository) is stored in the same file as the provided python file, dat_converter.py.
Simply run the .py file in command line or your favorite IDE and fill out the GUIs as desired. 
After completion, you should be left with 3 new .dat files, saved in the same folder that the origional .csv and the .py file were in.
